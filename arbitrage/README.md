## Arbitrage Oppurtunity Finder

Use the 1inch API to find swap pairs with arbitrage oppurtunities, for use with flash loans or other applications.

To run
```
yarn add web3 node-fetch
ts-node 1inch_swap_arbitrage.ts dai 1000000000000000000000 gemini
```

I included some token lists in the project, but they will go stale quickly. You can download these lists online easily.
